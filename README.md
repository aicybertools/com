Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql

sql
Copy code
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
